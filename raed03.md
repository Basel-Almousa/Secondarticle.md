# What is a wireframe
+ Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
+  This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.
## Examples of wireframes
+ Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
+ With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
+ Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions. 
## The best tools for wireframing
+ UXPin: UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive clickable prototypes directly in your browser.
+ InVision: InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. It’s completely free too!
+ Wireframe.cc: Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.
## Steps to make wireframe in six steps

3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
## Three key principles to make goode wireframe

# What is HTML?
+ HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
+ HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
+ HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
## The main parts of HTML elements 
1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
