## How to go from fixed to growth mindset?
__Acknowledge and embrace imperfections__
~~Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them~~
**View challenges as opportunities**
*Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement*
***Try different learning tactics There’s no one-size-fits-all model for learning. What works for one person may not work for you.***
